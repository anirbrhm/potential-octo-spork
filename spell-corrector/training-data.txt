   - You might feel like this because you stay alone, but you do have people who care about you and are just a call away
   - You are not alone in this, it will be fine
   - Try to see the good things about yourself, focus more on the positive
   - You are loved by a lot of people, you just don’t realize it
   - You have the best of friends and you friends will always support you 
   - You are truly wanted and loved by your people around you 
   - You will have a wonderful career ahead 
   - Times will be great again and you will soon feel wonderful about yourself even if you don’t know 
   - You have absolutely no reason to be so negative about yourself, you are truly an amazing individual 
   - Although it might not look like it right now, but you will soon be over it and living your life to the fullest 
   - This suffering will only make you a stronger individual and you will soon be over it 
   - Strongest of characters have to go through the suffering that you are going through. You just have to learn from it and use it to better yourself. 
   - Life is very long and these bad moments are there to teach us things otherwise we take for granted. 
   - If you keep working hard the way you are doing, it will definitely take your career to the places you want it to go 
   - Failures are necessary in your journey, as they teach you a lot about taking the right steps 
   - These failures will be the stepping stones for your success if you learn from them 
   - Failure isn't fatal, but failure to change might be
   - Everything you want is on the other side of fear
   - Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
   - Giving up is the only sure way to fail
   - Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing
   - When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important
   - It's failure that gives you the proper perspective on success
   - Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
   - You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door in the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on them. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space
   - It is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default
   - Failure is a part of the process. You just learn to pick yourself back up
   - We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes – understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success
   - Learning from more mistakes simply means you are learning faster
