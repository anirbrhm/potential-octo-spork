    - You have absolutely no reason to be so negative about yourself, you are truly an amazing individual
    - Times will be great again and you will soon feel wonderful about yourself even if you don’t know
    - You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door in the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on them. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space
    - You might feel like this because you stay alone, but you do have people who care about you and are just a call away
