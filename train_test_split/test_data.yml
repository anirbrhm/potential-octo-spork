    - Try to see the good things about yourself, focus more on the positive
    - Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing
    - Failure is a part of the process. You just learn to pick yourself back up
    - When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important
    - If you keep working hard the way you are doing, it will definitely take your career to the places you want it to go
    - Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts
